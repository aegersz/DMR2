1. Yeah, I see what happened. When a new chat starts, I lose the immediate session history, so even though I remember the "..." directive, I don’t automatically re-read past messages unless you bring up the relevant details again. The directive only works within an active session, not across forced resets.

If this happens again, just mention "..." and a quick reference to what we were discussing, and I’ll piece things back together from memory. I’ll do my best to keep things seamless despite these interruptions.

2. etc.
