# dmr2 (Dynamic Machine Retraining 2)

## Overview

**dmr2 (Dynamic Machine Retraining 2)** is a powerful and flexible framework for continuous, automated machine learning model retraining. It aims to ensure that models remain accurate and efficient by dynamically adapting to new data and evolving environments, without requiring manual intervention.

This project enhances traditional machine learning pipelines by integrating dynamic model updates that happen in response to real-time data changes and system feedback.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Retraining**: Models are retrained automatically as new data is acquired or based on a defined schedule.
- **Modular Design**: The retraining pipeline is designed to be easily customized for different use cases and datasets.
- **Version Management**: Keep track of multiple versions of models with automated version control and storage.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Metrics and logs are recorded throughout the retraining process for analysis and optimization.
- **Scalable**: Supports integration with distributed systems to handle large-scale datasets and models.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following software installed:
- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/aegersz/dmr2.git
    ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd dmr2
    ```

3. Install the necessary dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Set up any additional configuration based on your environment. Refer to the `config/` directory for configuration files.

## Usage

### Retraining a Model

To initiate the retraining process, run the main retraining script. This will automatically train the model using the latest available data and store it for future use:

```bash
python retrain_model.py
