# Dynamic Machine Retraining

## Overview

The **Dynamic Machine Retraining** project enables real-time or periodic retraining of machine learning models. This system ensures that models stay up-to-date with changing data, improving their accuracy and performance as new information becomes available.

## Features

- **Real-time Retraining**: The system can retrain models dynamically as new data is collected.
- **Version Control**: Track and manage different versions of retrained models.
- **Automated Pipelines**: Set up automated pipelines for data preprocessing, training, and model evaluation.
- **Scalability**: The retraining system is designed to scale with large datasets and complex machine learning models.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Keep track of model performance over time, with logs for retraining processes and metrics.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/aegersz/dmt2.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd dynamic-machine-retraining
    ```
3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

### 1. Set Up Data Input
Ensure your data pipeline is ready. The system can work with data in formats like CSV, JSON, or directly from databases. Configure the input settings in `config/data_config.json`.

### 2. Configure Retraining Parameters
Adjust the retraining frequency and model hyperparameters in `config/retrain_config.json`.

### 3. Start the Retraining Process
Run the retraining script to start the process:
```bash
python retrain_model.py
