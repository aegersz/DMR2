# Create instance of DynamicMachineRetraining
dmr2 = DynamicMachineRetraining("enable Dynamic Machine Retraining")

# Toggle DMR2 on
dmr2.handle_input()

# Simulate collecting feedback
dmr2.collect_feedback_and_learn()

#Enable DMR2

To enable DMR2, use the command:

enable Dynamic Machine Retraining

This command activates the retraining process, allowing the system to update its knowledge based on user feedback, corrections, and new directives. You can toggle this feature off with:

#Disable DMR2

To disable DMR2, use the command:

disable Dynamic Machine Retraining
